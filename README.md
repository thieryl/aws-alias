# awscli-aliases
Repository for AWS CLI aliases.

## Requirements

Make sure that you are using version ``1.11.24`` or higher of the AWS CLI.
You can determine the version by running:
```
$ aws --version
```

For information on installation and upgrading of the AWS CLI, please refer
to the [AWS CLI User Guide](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/installing.html).


## Quickstart

To start using aliases available in this repository, run the following
commands:

Note that running the commands below **will** delete any existing alias
file you may have had:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/thieryl/awscli-alias.git ~/.aws/cli
```

To test that the aliases now work, run the following alias:
```
aws whoami
```

This will display the same response as the ``aws sts get-caller-identity``
command:
```
{
    "Account": "012345678901",
    "UserId": "AIUAINBADX2VEG2TC6HD6",
    "Arn": "arn:aws:iam::012345678901:user/myuser"
}
```
